Standalone documents that don't belong in the app or the code.

### Product & demo

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`TRAINING.md`](./TRAINING.md) | Hands-on 90-minute walkthrough of Procela. Written against the Tidewater Utilities demo fixture; the shape (Modules 1–12) applies to any customer once their own data is loaded. Served in-app at **Help → Training**. |
| [`demo-playbook.html`](./demo-playbook.html) | Presenter's runbook for the 45-minute Procela demo against the Tidewater Utilities fixture. Open in a browser or Cmd/Ctrl-P to print. |
| [`edge-connector-demo.md`](./edge-connector-demo.md) | One-command Docker demo (`docker compose --profile demo up --build`) that runs real on-prem edge connectors against a seeded source database — split by industry (a Tidewater Utilities connector scans `utility`, a Momentum Industries connector scans `shipbuilder`) to show discovery and connector-measured data quality. |
| [`capability-matrix.md`](./capability-matrix.md) / [`.csv`](./capability-matrix.csv) | Feature coverage vs. the four primary benchmarks (Collibra, Alation, Atlan, Ataccama) — for sales / RFP responses. |

### Go-live & operations

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`GO_LIVE_CHECKLIST.md`](./GO_LIVE_CHECKLIST.md) | What remains between "demo-ready" and running a real customer in production — infra, secrets, ops, and roadmap, plus the fast-path subset for a single pilot. |
| [`PILOT_GO_LIVE_WORKSHEET.md`](./PILOT_GO_LIVE_WORKSHEET.md) | The fast-path subset above, as an ordered tick-through operator worksheet for standing up one pilot customer on AWS. All ops/config, no code. |
| [`DEPLOY_RUNBOOK.md`](./DEPLOY_RUNBOOK.md) | Day-0 secret & config provisioning: how to generate each secret, where it lives (AWS Secrets Manager / Helm), and how to verify the app came up configured. Covers checklist #6–#12. Opens with a **Deployment models** section (multi-tenant SaaS vs. SaaS + on-prem connector vs. fully on-premise). |
| [`DR_RUNBOOK.md`](./DR_RUNBOOK.md) | Disaster-recovery procedures — restore from backup, roll back a migration, rotate a compromised secret, full rebuild — for checklist #23. |
| [`RELEASING.md`](./RELEASING.md) | How the on-prem connector container image is released and published to GHCR — `connector-v*` tags → semver + `latest`, trunk → `edge`/`sha-*`, manual dispatch, provenance/SBOM, and the one-time package-visibility prerequisite. |

### Planning & roadmap

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`ROADMAP.md`](./ROADMAP.md) | Post-cutover roadmap: the four frontiers beyond the go-live tail (Phase 3 discovery loop, production-scale hardening, commercial SaaS readiness, depth on existing features), with sizing left un-sequenced pending a go-to-market call. |
| [`future-work.csv`](./future-work.csv) | Granular, itemized engineering backlog (feature-level tickets with priority + status). The tactical companion to the strategic tracks in `ROADMAP.md`. |

### Architecture & data model

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`POSTGRES.md`](./POSTGRES.md) | How to run the backend against Postgres locally and the repository pattern every entity follows. The cutover is complete; this is the reference shape for adding a **new** entity. |
| [`POSTGRES_CUTOVER_PLAN.md`](./POSTGRES_CUTOVER_PLAN.md) | Engineering plan (now executed) for moving persistence from JSON files to Postgres — current state, the boot-safety fix, and the ~10-PR sequence with critical path. Historical record of the cutover. |
| [`POSTGRES_CUTOVER_PR5_REPORT_ENGINE.md`](./POSTGRES_CUTOVER_PR5_REPORT_ENGINE.md) | File-level conversion design for the riskiest cutover step — routing the report engine through repositories without per-row N+1 joins. |
| [`DATA_OWNERSHIP.md`](./DATA_OWNERSHIP.md) | Which tables and columns are written by the interactive UI / REST API versus the on-prem edge agent (`@procela/connector`) — the four co-managed tables, their column-level split, the audit-only write stance, and how the connector (Option 2) maps onto a direct Connection (Option 1) as the metadata-only subset of the same catalog. |
| [`RBAC_PERMISSION_MATRIX.md`](./RBAC_PERMISSION_MATRIX.md) | Authoritative reference for role-based authorization. `packages/backend/src/lib/permissions.ts` is the source of truth; this explains it. |

### GA tightening audit

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`GA_TIGHTENING_AUDIT.md`](./GA_TIGHTENING_AUDIT.md) | Full field-level census (63 models / ~653 columns) for the first commercial release — dead columns, redundant fields, low-value fields, plus scheduler/RBAC/mocked-surface items, with a staged migration-safe plan. Sections A–G are now closed. |
| [`ga-tightening-report.html`](./ga-tightening-report.html) | Plain-language, stakeholder-facing readout of the GA tightening audit — the readable front door to `GA_TIGHTENING_AUDIT.md`. Open in a browser (renders light/dark, mobile-friendly). |

For in-app help see `packages/backend/src/docs/HELP.md` (the Help page).
