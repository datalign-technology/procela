# Procela Training Guide

A hands-on walkthrough of Procela. The exercises below use the
fictional **Tidewater Utilities** demo fixture that ships with the
platform — a mid-size investor-owned utility with electric, water,
and shared-services divisions. Every module works the same way
against your own organization once it's loaded: same pages, same
buttons, same expected behaviours. Swap the sample names for yours.

By the end you will have:

- A populated environment with two utility divisions (electric + water)
  and shared services
- Defined business processes for each division
- Linked data assets, systems, ownership, and skills
- Exercised every value-loop feature Procela ships with
- Built a real cross-entity report and watched the gaps you'd care
  about light up

Plan on **90 minutes** end-to-end the first time through. The setup
phase (Module 1) is a one-time cost; modules 2–9 can be done in any
order once setup is complete.

---

## Prerequisites

| Item | What you need |
|---|---|
| **Running dev environment** | Backend on `:3001`, frontend on `:5173` (`npm run dev` from the repo root) |
| **Signed in** | As a `SUPER_ADMIN` or `ORG_ADMIN` so you can import and create |
| **Fresh data store** | Recommended for a clean walkthrough. Use **Settings → Reset everything** to wipe before starting (super-admins only) |
| **Test data files** | `test-data/utility/` — already in the repo |

---

## Module 1 — Load the data (10 min)

This is the foundation. Every subsequent module assumes the org tree,
systems, and people listed below have been imported.

### 1.1 Organizations

1. Navigate to **Organizations** (left nav).
2. Click **Import** in the page header.
3. Paste the contents of `test-data/utility/organizations.csv`.
4. Leave the **Parent** dropdown blank (these are top-level orgs).
5. Click **Import**.

You'll see the whole hierarchy appear:

```
Tidewater Utilities (company)
├── Tidewater Electric (division)
│   ├── Power Generation
│   ├── Transmission & Distribution
│   ├── Electric Customer Service
│   ├── Electric Engineering
│   └── Electric Asset Management
├── Tidewater Water (division)
│   ├── Water Production
│   ├── Water Distribution
│   ├── Wastewater Operations
│   ├── Water Customer Service
│   └── Water Engineering
└── Shared Services (division)
    ├── Information Technology
    ├── Finance & Accounting
    ├── Human Resources
    ├── Regulatory Affairs
    └── Safety & Environmental
```

### 1.2 Systems

1. Set the **Working in…** picker (top of every page) to **Tidewater
   Utilities**.
2. Go to **Systems** → **Import**.
3. Paste `test-data/utility/systems.csv`. Import.

You'll get ~25 systems: SCADA, GIS, CIS, AMI, hydraulic modelling,
plus shared corporate systems (ERP, HRIS, data warehouse).

### 1.3 People

People are imported **one file per department**. Set the *Working in…*
picker for each, then import:

| File | Scope to |
|---|---|
| `people-executives.csv` | Tidewater Utilities |
| `people-data-owners.csv` | Tidewater Utilities |
| `people-electric.csv` | Tidewater Electric |
| `people-water.csv` | Tidewater Water |
| `people-shared-services.csv` | Shared Services |
| `people-electric-generation.csv` | Power Generation |
| `people-electric-td.csv` | Transmission & Distribution |
| `people-electric-customer.csv` | Electric Customer Service |
| `people-electric-engineering.csv` | Electric Engineering |
| `people-electric-assets.csv` | Electric Asset Management |
| `people-water-production.csv` | Water Production |
| `people-water-distribution.csv` | Water Distribution |
| `people-water-wastewater.csv` | Wastewater Operations |
| `people-water-customer.csv` | Water Customer Service |
| `people-water-engineering.csv` | Water Engineering |
| `people-it.csv` | Information Technology |
| `people-finance.csv` | Finance & Accounting |
| `people-hr.csv` | Human Resources |
| `people-regulatory.csv` | Regulatory Affairs |
| `people-safety.csv` | Safety & Environmental |

### 1.4 Agents

1. Working in… **Tidewater Utilities**.
2. **Agents** → **Import** → paste `agents.csv`.

Five agents land — one of each type (AI, PIPELINE, BOT,
SERVICE_ACCOUNT, OTHER) so you see the shape of the concept without
being buried in owner-assignments. Extend the CSV once the model
clicks.

Every imported agent arrives as **Paused**. That's not a bug —
Procela enforces a *responsible-person invariant*: an agent can only
be Active when it has a real person assigned as accountable for its
behaviour. Assign a Responsible Person to each row, then flip the
Status from Paused to Active. Use these picks — they match the
imported roster and the accountability shape you'd expect in a real
utility:

| Agent | Type | Responsible Person | Why this person |
|---|---|---|---|
| Outage Prediction Model | AI | **Amara Wambui** (Manager Data & Analytics) | Owns ML models against operational data |
| AMI Meter Ingestion Pipeline | PIPELINE | **Kwame Osei** (Lead Data Engineer) | Pipeline delivery is his team |
| Customer Notification Bot | BOT | **Samira Farooq** (Manager Contact Center) | Customer-facing bot; contact-center accountable |
| PI Historian Service Account | SERVICE_ACCOUNT | **Tobias Reinholt** (Manager OT Cybersecurity) | Non-human identity into OT/SCADA lands with OT security |
| Compliance Report Generator | OTHER | **Isabella Rossi** (Manager Water Compliance) | NPDES/DMR filings are water-compliance owned |

Try setting an agent to Active *without* picking a person first —
the option is greyed out and the form warns you inline. That's the
invariant in action.

Later, if you delete or deactivate one of the people above on the
**Organizations → People** page, every active agent they own
auto-pauses and a governance issue opens. Look for the *"N active
agents were auto-paused"* toast; the issues land in **Governance →
Tasks & Issues** with severity HIGH for a lead to pick up.

### 1.5 Seed the skill catalog

1. Navigate to **Organizations → Skills**.
2. Click **Seed standard skills**.

About 40 DAMA-aligned skills will land. The catalog feeds the qualified-
person checks you'll exercise in Module 6.

### Checkpoint

- Switch *Working in…* to **Tidewater Electric**. The People count in
  the left nav should drop to electric-division staff.
- Switch to **Tidewater Water**. Same again, different roster.
- This is **multi-tenant scoping** in action — every read filters by
  the active org.

---

## Module 2 — Get oriented (10 min)

### 2.1 The Working in… picker

Top of every page. This is the single most important control in
Procela. It scopes *everything* — what you see, what you can edit,
what AI runs against. Spend a minute switching between **Tidewater
Utilities**, **Tidewater Electric**, and **Tidewater Water** and
watching the Dashboard KPIs recompute.

### 2.2 Dashboard

The Dashboard's **Overview** strip shows the live KPI tiles. Each is a
hyperlink:

- **Value Streams** / **Processes** → Process Catalog
- **Data Assets** → Data Assets page
- **Systems** → Systems page
- **Coverage** → Data Mapping (where unmapped activities + unlinked
  assets surface)
- **Avg Health** → Data Assets sorted by health ascending (worst at
  top)

The personal **My Dashboard** strip at the top has its own four tiles
— also hyperlinks — that scope to the signed-in user:

- **Open Tasks** → Governance Work (Tasks tab)
- **Open Issues** → Governance Work (Issues tab)
- **My Domains** → Data Domains (the ones you own or steward)
- **Upcoming Events** → Governance Calendar

Sub-counts surface when relevant (e.g. *"3 overdue"* in red under
Open Tasks). Zero-count tiles fade the number but still link through.

Below the KPIs the Dashboard shows its state as charts, not just
numbers:

- **Governance Posture** — a tier-mix donut (Certified / Managed /
  Uncertified assets) beside semicircular **Coverage** and **Avg
  Health** gauges.
- **Trends** — sparklines of Coverage, Avg Health and Open Gaps over
  the last several weeks, each with a ▲/▼ delta; the headline matches
  the live Overview tile.
- **Governance Gaps** — the open gap signals as a critical-vs-warning
  severity bar over a list of counts, each linking to its fix.
- **Catalog Shape** — bars for the size of each process level (Value
  Streams → Processes → Sub-processes → Activities).

**Make it yours.** Click **Customize** to reorder each section
(arrows), set its width **Half** (two-up, tighter) or **Full** (own
row), and show/hide it. The layout is saved automatically per browser;
**Reset to Default** restores the shipped importance-ordered
arrangement.

Skim the rest of the page: **Program Maturity** (current governance
phase), **Skill Gaps** (more on this in Module 6).

### 2.3 The org tree

Open **Organizations → Structure**. The visualization shows the full
hierarchy you imported. Click any node — counts on the right pane
recompute, drill into a division or department to see its people.

### 2.4 People

Open **Organizations → People** with *Working in…* set to **Tidewater
Electric**. You should see the electric-division roster only. Try:

- The **Skill** filter (top toolbar) — narrow to everyone who holds a
  given competency
- The **Skill gaps** column (right side) — currently `—` for everyone
  because activities don't have required-skill data yet. We'll come
  back to this in Module 6.

### 2.5 The Get Started page

Open **Get Started** in the sidebar. It's your onboarding hub — a
resumable, data-driven journey through three phases: **Capture**,
**Assign**, **Govern**. Each phase is an accordion you expand to
work through checklist items with per-item Open links. The
progress ring in the header aggregates the three phases so you
can see how close you are to fully set up.

By default (the **Auto** setting) the sidebar entry auto-hides once
you reach 100%, so the "you're done" state stays clean. You can
change this under **Settings → Get Started guide** with an
**Auto / Always / Hidden** control — *Always* keeps the entry
pinned even after you finish, *Hidden* removes it entirely. That
choice is a global, per-user preference: it follows you across
every organization rather than being set per org. Nothing else on
the platform is gated by finishing the phases — you can drive
straight to the Process Catalog from a fresh org — but the hub
makes it obvious what's still missing.

### 2.6 Where's Help?

The Help button lives in the **top bar next to Ask AI**, not in
the sidebar. Clicking it opens the guide in a popup window so
you keep whatever page you were on. The Training Guide follows
the same pattern. Direct-URL deep links (like `/help#connectors`)
still resolve.

---

## Module 3 — Define processes (15 min)

### 3.1 AI-generated process hierarchy for Electric

1. *Working in…* → **Tidewater Electric**.
2. Navigate to **Processes** → click the wand (**Generate processes**).
3. Procela calls Claude with the active org context. After 10–30
   seconds, a preview hierarchy appears.
4. Review: you should see electric-utility value streams — Outage
   Management, Generation, Transmission & Distribution, Customer
   Operations, Regulatory Compliance.
5. Click **Apply**.

### 3.2 Same wand, different division

1. Switch *Working in…* → **Tidewater Water**.
2. **Processes** → wand again.
3. Different output: Water Treatment, Distribution, Wastewater
   Operations, Customer Operations.

That's the active-org context driving Claude differently — same code
path, different result. The first run for each (industry + org) pair
hits Claude live; subsequent runs return the cached result instantly.
The badge on the review screen says *Specialised: <Org>*.

### 3.3 Walk the catalog

With *Working in…* on **Tidewater Electric**:

- Expand a value stream → process → sub-process → activity.
- Click an **Activity** node. The right panel shows level-specific
  fields: Owner, Responsible Role, Responsible Person, Systems,
  Required Skills, Inputs/Outputs, Status, Frequency, Risk Level.
- Concrete example — on an **Outage Management → Outage triage**
  activity, set:
  - **Responsible Role** = `System Operator Lead`
  - **Responsible Person** = **Melissa Patel** (System Operator
    Lead, T&D) — search "Melissa" in the picker
  - **Owner** = **Harold Lindstrom** (Manager Distribution Control
    Center)
  - **Systems** = SCADA + OMS
  - Save.
- The **Status lifecycle** is Draft → Active → Deprecated. Click the
  status pill to advance it — leave this one on Active.

### 3.4 Inputs / Outputs panel

On the same activity, click **+ Add Input** in the I/O panel. The
segmented picker has three tabs:

- **Data Asset** — operational data this activity consumes
- **Governance Document** — a charter / policy / standard the activity
  references
- **Attachment** — uploaded file or URL

Try adding a Data Asset (we'll create some in Module 4).

### 3.5 Dependencies

Expand any **Activity** in the catalog and scroll to the
**Dependencies** panel — two columns, *Predecessors* and
*Successors*. This is where you declare "what has to run before
this activity" and "what this activity unblocks."

Try it on the **Outage Management → Outage triage** activity from
Module 3.3:

1. Add a Predecessor: *Field crew dispatched* (or the closest
   preceding activity the wand generated).
2. Add a Successor: *Customer notification sent*.

Watch what the platform enforces:

- **Cycles are blocked.** Try adding *Customer notification sent*
  as a Predecessor of *Outage triage* — Procela rejects it with
  *"Adding this flow would create a cycle. Use a LOOP-type flow if
  the cycle is intentional."*
- **Cross-value-stream warnings.** Adding an activity from a
  different value stream tags the row with a small amber
  `CROSS-STREAM` chip — legal (some dependencies really do cross
  streams), but usually a wrong pick.
- **Delete cascades.** When you delete an activity, every
  dependency edge touching it goes with it. No dangling references.

The compact `←N →M` chip on collapsed activity rows in the tree
shows incoming/outgoing counts at a glance.

### 3.6 BCM + measurable-target attributes

Switch the tree view to **Advanced** (top of the Process Catalog).
Four extra fields appear on each Activity, right below Automation
and Estimated Duration:

| Field | What it's for | Try on *Outage triage* |
|---|---|---|
| **Criticality** | Business-continuity tier | *Tier 1 — Mission critical* |
| **RTO (hours)** | Recovery Time Objective | `4` |
| **Success Measure** | Measurable target next to the narrative outcome | *Field crew on site within 30 minutes for Tier 1 outages* |
| **SLA Target** | Free-text SLA — accept whatever fits | *P95 30 min from detection* |

Then scroll one more field down to **Controls** — a multi-select
tied to the controls you defined on **Governance → Documents**. If
you haven't defined any controls yet, the picker reads *"Define
controls on Governance Documents first"* — a small hint pointing
you to the right page rather than leaving you guessing.

Add one control if you have any defined (e.g. NERC CIP-007 R2.1
from your Governance seed). Delete that control later on Governance
Documents and watch this picker — the chip disappears
automatically. No dangling references.

Why this matters: a regulator asking *"what's the RTO for outage
triage?"* now gets a real answer from the platform. Dashboards can
group activities by criticalityTier. And the Controls link closes
the loop between a policy definition and the concrete work that
implements it — the reverse view (which activities implement this
control?) is available from Governance Documents.

### 3.7 Change-management review workflow

For enterprise buyers, "who approved this?" isn't optional. Switch
your org into review mode and watch the workflow appear:

1. Go to **Settings → Process & Asset Lifecycle**. The picker is a
   three-way segmented control: **Simple** (default), **Review**,
   **Advanced**. Click **Review** and confirm the switch.
2. Back on the Process Catalog, find an **Active** activity (e.g.
   *Outage triage*) and change its status pill to **Draft** — you'll
   need to make it draft to trigger a change cycle.
3. Edit any field (say, bump the RTO from 4 to 2 hours).
4. Click the status pill again — the only option is **Pending
   Review**. Pick it. A yellow banner drops with a text box asking
   *"What are you changing?"* Type "Tightened RTO after Q3
   incident review" and click **Submit for review**.
5. Watch the status pill change to **Pending Review** and a yellow
   banner appear on the row: *"Pending review — submitted by
   Melissa Patel · 2 min ago"* with your comment underneath.
6. Open the notifications bell — a new item lands:
   *"Change submitted for review: Outage triage"*.

Now switch to a different user (e.g. Harold Lindstrom, Melissa's
manager) and act as reviewer:

7. Open the same activity and click the status pill. Two options:
   **Active** (approve) and **Draft** (request changes). Pick
   **Active** → a comment box appears; type *"Approved — noted the
   incident postmortem"* → click **Approve**. Status flips to
   **Active**.
8. Sign back in as Melissa — the bell shows *"Change approved:
   Outage triage"*.

Two things Procela enforces you'll want to demo:

- **Segregation of duties.** Sign in as Melissa (the submitter) and
  try to approve her own submission — the platform blocks it with
  *"The submitter cannot approve their own change. A different
  reviewer must sign off."* She can still **Request changes** on
  her own submission (self-withdrawal).
- **Fresh cycle after rejection.** If a reviewer requests changes,
  Melissa's next Submit for review starts clean — the earlier
  reviewer's decision doesn't carry over, so nothing looks
  pre-approved that isn't.

Switch back to **Simple** mode when you're done to keep the rest
of the training uncluttered — the migration confirmation dialog
walks any Pending Review rows back to Draft.

### 3.8 Phase 3 suggestion panels

Scroll past the I/O panel on an expanded activity. You'll see three
"Suggested…" cards: **Suggested data assets**, **Suggested systems**,
and **Suggested people**. Procela ranks candidates against the
activity's name, description, declared systems, and required skills.
Each row carries a High / Medium / Low confidence chip and a one-line
rationale ("Same system as the step (SAP)", "Has 2 of 2 required
skills").

- **Accept** wires the candidate into the right slot in one click
  (asset → adds a mapping; system → appended to the step's systems;
  person → assigned as Responsible).
- **Dismiss** tells Procela not to suggest this candidate again for
  this step. The decision persists across sessions (learning loop).
- Panels hide themselves when nothing scores above threshold — fully
  mapped activities don't accumulate dead UI.

We'll come back to this in Module 5 once we have assets to map.

---

## Module 4 — Register data + systems (10 min)

### 4.1 Data Assets

1. *Working in…* → **Tidewater Electric**.
2. **Data Assets** page → **+ Add data asset**.
3. Create these four — the *Domain* column is which Data Domain
   you'll assign each to once you create the domains in step 4.3.
   The *Owner Override* column tells you which assets need a
   specific person (leave blank to inherit the domain owner):

| Name | Description | Data Type | Trust Level | Domain | Owner Override |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Outage Logs | Per-event SCADA records of distribution outages | Operational | Bronze | Operational Data | — (inherit) |
| Customer Master | Service addresses, account status, billing terms | Master | Silver | Customer Data | — (inherit) |
| Meter Reads | AMI 15-min interval consumption | Operational | Silver | Operational Data | **Andre Ferguson** (Manager Billing & Revenue) — revenue owns the billed reads even though the data lives in Operational |
| Generation Output | Plant-level MWh by hour | Operational | Bronze | Operational Data | **Deborah Kwon** (Data Steward Generation) — as override Owner because Generation is a separate accountability line from T&D |

4. Assign Owners and Stewards using the person picker — but only
   when the asset needs someone different from the domain's default.
   By default, an asset inherits its Owner and Stewards from its
   Data Domain. Look under the Owner picker: if you leave it empty
   and the domain has an owner assigned, you'll see a hint reading
   *"Inherits from domain — <person>"*. The row still renders with
   the domain's owner as the effective one. Same for Stewards.
   Pick a specific person only when the asset has its own
   accountable person (regulatory scope, cross-functional dataset,
   delegation) — the hint switches to *"Overrides domain (…) —
   Reset to domain owner"*. In the table above, only Meter Reads
   and Generation Output override the domain owner — the other two
   inherit cleanly. Set the Domain first in step 4.3 below.

### 4.2 Connect Assets to Systems

In each asset's edit form, set **System of Record** (e.g. Outage Logs
→ SCADA; Customer Master → CIS; Meter Reads → AMI). This is how
Procela knows which system carries the canonical copy.

### 4.3 Data Domains

1. **Data Domains** page → create three domains with these exact
   owners and stewards — each pick matches a real person on the
   imported roster and matches how a mid-sized utility organises
   accountability:

| Domain | Owner | Steward(s) |
|---|---|---|
| Customer Data | **Devon Kershaw** (Data Owner Tidewater Electric) | **Natalie Greer** (Data Steward Customer Data) |
| Operational Data | **Jennifer Vasquez** (Director Transmission & Distribution Ops) | **Brandon Willis** (Data Steward Grid Operations) + **Deborah Kwon** (Data Steward Generation) |
| Regulatory Data | **Lorraine Kimura** (Director Regulatory Affairs) | **Phillip Rosenberg** (Data Steward Compliance Evidence) |

   While you're here, set **Criticality** on each domain — mark
   *Customer Data* and *Regulatory Data* as **Tier-1 (critical)** and
   leave *Operational Data* at a lower tier. Tier-1 is what the Council
   Scorecard (Module 10.4) measures for coverage, so this flag is what
   makes a domain count toward the enterprise report card.

2. Go back to each asset from step 4.1 and assign it to its domain.
   Watch the Owner picker on **Outage Logs** and **Customer Master**
   — the hint reads *"Inherits from domain — Jennifer Vasquez"* and
   *"Inherits from domain — Devon Kershaw"* respectively. That's
   the inheritance model doing its job: two assets, zero explicit
   owner assignments, still accountable.

3. On **Meter Reads** and **Generation Output**, pick the override
   owners from the 4.1 table. The hint switches to *"Overrides
   domain — Reset to domain owner"* — a one-click undo if you
   change your mind.

The domain assignments feed the Governance Groups page in Module 8.

### 4.4 The Data Asset 360 view — Sensitivity + Impact

Click any asset in the list to open the **Data Asset 360** modal.
Two panels there are worth pausing on because they're the ones a
steward reaches for during a real change:

**Sensitivity — Suggest & Review.** Click *Suggest sensitivity
tags* on the Sensitivity chip row. Procela AI reads the asset's
name + description and proposes tags (PII, PHI, PCI, FINANCIAL,
CREDENTIAL, CONFIDENTIAL, PUBLIC) with a confidence label. Each
suggestion has its own **Accept / Reject** button — you don't
have to swallow all of them or none. Rejected tags stay
rejected across re-runs so a subsequent *Suggest* doesn't re-
propose the same thing. Try it on **Customer Master** — the
AI reliably suggests PII on the account/address content.

**Impact analysis — "If this asset changes, what breaks?"** The
*Impact* panel below the Sensitivity row runs
`GET /data-assets/:id/impact` and returns four counts: how many
activities consume the asset, how many processes those roll up
to, how many value streams that touches, and how many people
need to be told. The **Notify** list expands to a per-person
row — each entry shows *why* they'd be notified (Owner on
Outage triage, Domain steward for Customer Data, etc.). Use
this before deprecating a system or retiring a field: the
Notify list is your change-comms distribution list.

### 4.5 How real Data Assets arrive in production

In this training you're typing the assets in by hand — fine for a demo. In production most orgs seed the catalog one of two ways:

1. **Data Connections** (see *6. Systems → Connections* in the Help Guide). Procela's backend makes outbound calls to your database using credentials you provide, and the **Discover assets** button walks the schema. Works for cloud warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, Databricks) and any internal database Procela can route to.

2. **On-prem connector.** A small container the customer runs *inside their network*. It scans configured Postgres, SQL Server, or MySQL databases every 30 minutes and reports catalog metadata to Procela over an outbound HTTPS connection. Connection strings never leave the on-prem host. Use this when Procela cannot reach the source directly.

Either way, discovered assets arrive as **Bronze** tier, unowned, unmapped — deliberately, so they show up in the Orphan Assets and Ungoverned dashboards as work items for stewards. This training doesn't spin up a real database, but the *behaviour* is worth knowing: a real deployment doesn't manually type in 400 tables, and it *shouldn't* auto-promote them either.

If you're rolling out to a customer now, keep going with the training as-is, then read the **6. Systems → On-prem connectors** section of the Help Guide for the install commands and the pairing flow.

---

## Module 5 — Connect processes to data (10 min)

### 5.1 Inline mapping on the catalog

The day-to-day mapping workflow is **inside the Process Catalog**, not
on the Mappings page.

1. Open the **Outage Management → Outage triage** activity — the
   one Melissa Patel is Responsible for from Module 3.3.
2. In the **Inputs / Outputs** panel, click **+ Add Input** → tab
   *Data Asset* → pick *Outage Logs*.
3. Add an output: **+ Add Output** → *Customer Master* (the activity
   updates the customer record with the outage event).
4. Repeat with two more mappings to give the map in step 5.4
   something to draw:
   - **Meter Reading → Interval read ingest** (or the closest
     activity the wand generated) → **Input: Meter Reads**
   - **Customer Onboarding → Account creation** (or equivalent) →
     **Output: Customer Master**

### 5.2 Cross-process review

1. Navigate to **Insights → Explore → Data Mapping**.
2. You'll see your mappings as a flat audit list. Three column highlights:
   - **Process Activity** — full breadcrumb (Value Stream → Process →
     Activity)
   - **Target** — typed tag (ASSET / DOCUMENT / ATTACHMENT) plus the
     target name and sub-detail
   - **Link Type** — `INPUT` / `OUTPUT` / `REFERENCE`
3. Try the **Batch Mapping Wizard** (top action) — matrix interface
   for creating many mappings at once.

### 5.3 Cross-division warning

This is the moment most platforms fail silently. Try this:

1. Working in… **Tidewater Water**.
2. Open a Water activity (e.g. *Water Quality Sampling*).
3. Add an input — try picking *Outage Logs* (an Electric asset).
4. Procela warns: *"Outage Logs is owned by Tidewater Electric, but
   Water Quality Sampling sits in Tidewater Water. Cross-division
   links usually mean the wrong target was picked — pick again, or
   confirm if this is genuinely a shared dependency."*

Cancel out. The default is **warn, not block** — confirming creates
the link normally.

### 5.4 The Process ↔ Data map (visualization)

Now that you have a few mappings, navigate to **Insights → Explore →
Process ↔ Data Map** (it sits next to Data Mapping — same data,
different read: Data Mapping is the table, this is the picture).
You'll see a bipartite SVG: activities on the left grouped
by parent process, mapped data assets on the right grouped by system,
and a coloured curve for every mapping — green for produces, blue for
consumes, purple for transforms.

- The header reads `N activities · N mapped assets · N mappings ·
  M/N activities have at least one mapping`. Watch that ratio as you
  add mappings — that's your coverage in one number.
- Click an activity. Connected rows stay bright; the rest fade. The
  Clear focus button appears above the legend. Click an asset and
  the reverse holds — you see every step that touches it.
- Use the System filter to answer "what processes use SCADA" in two
  clicks.

This is the live view of what Module 5.2 audits in table form.

### 5.5 Phase 3 suggestion accept (loop closure)

Back on the Process Catalog, expand an activity that doesn't yet have
all its mappings. The **Suggested data assets** panel (from Module
3.5) should now offer the assets we created. Click **Accept** on a
high-confidence row — Procela adds the mapping, the suggestion
disappears, and the Process ↔ Data Map (Module 5.4) gains a new
edge. Refresh the map page if you want to see it.

---

## Module 6 — Exercise the skill value-loops (15 min)

The four cross-page workflows that turn the Skills catalog from data
into something operational. All four are exercised below.

### 6.1 Tag activities with required skills

1. Back on the **Outage triage** activity from Module 3.3 / 5.1.
   In the right panel, **Required Skills** is a multi-select.
2. Add these three: `Anomaly Detection`, `Stakeholder Management`,
   `Incident Response`.
3. Notice the amber chip that appears next to the picker:
   ***Responsible person lacks N required skills*** — Melissa Patel
   (the Responsible Person) doesn't hold these yet. This is the
   **qualified-person check**.

### 6.2 Skills on people

1. *Organizations → People* with *Working in…* = **Tidewater Electric**.
2. Click **Melissa Patel** to open her detail.
3. In the Skills panel, add `Anomaly Detection` and `Incident
   Response` — leave `Stakeholder Management` off on purpose.
4. Return to the Outage triage activity — the amber chip should
   now read ***lacks 1 required skill*** instead of 3. Hover for
   the tooltip that names the missing one (`Stakeholder
   Management`).

### 6.3 Find people by skill

1. People page toolbar — **Skill** dropdown.
2. Filter to `Anomaly Detection`. The roster narrows to holders.
3. Useful for staffing a new initiative.

### 6.4 Skill gaps column

Now the **Skill gaps** column on the People table is meaningful — it
shows the number of activities each person is responsible for that
require a skill they don't hold. Hover a number for the tooltip with
sample activity names.

### 6.5 Role recommendations

1. Click any DAMA role chip anywhere in the app (try **Governance →
   Roles** → click *Data Owner*).
2. The Role Detail drawer opens. Below "Skills typically needed" is
   **Best-matching people** — ranked by how many of the role's
   required skills each person already holds.
3. Click a row → jumps to that person's profile. Useful for filling
   unfilled roles.

### 6.6 Skill-gap report on the dashboard

Back to Dashboard. The **Skill Gaps** widget ranks the org's most
under-staffed required skills. Red = zero coverage (critical), amber
= tight, green = healthy. The link **Find people by skill →** jumps to
the People page.

## Module 7 — Assign accountability (10 min)

### 7.1 Governance Roles

1. **Governance → Roles** → **Assignments tab**.
2. Expand a category (Executive / Business / Technical) using the
   chevron. Note the **Expand all / Collapse all** controls at the
   top.
3. Click **CDO** (unfilled) → use the inline **+ Assign** → pick
   Susan Chen (from the executives import). Save.
4. Try the same for *Data Governance Lead* → Marisol Hadid.
5. Open the **Role Detail drawer** by clicking the *CDO* badge —
   you'll see the role definition, required skills, currently-held by,
   and best-matching people.

### 7.2 Per-division Data Owners

1. *Working in…* → **Tidewater Electric**.
2. **Governance → Roles** → click **Data Owner** in the sidebar.
3. **+ Assign** → Devon Kershaw, scope = **Tidewater Electric**.
4. Repeat for Tidewater Water (Yusuf Bashir) and Shared Services
   (Camille Petersen).

Data Owner is intentionally **per-division** in this fixture; one
person isn't responsible for the whole enterprise's data.

After assigning, notice each holder row shows a small kind tag next
to their scope: `ORG: Tidewater Electric` (indigo), or `DOMAIN:
Customer Data` (green) if you scoped them to a domain instead, or
`SYSTEM` / `ASSET` for entity-attached roles like System Owner.
Any holder row whose tag reads `UNKNOWN: unresolved` (amber) means
the scoped entity has been deleted — the same dangling-reference
signal you'll see on the Data Mapping page.

### 7.3 Domain coverage check

Scroll down to a domain-scoped role card (Data Owner, Data Steward,
Data Architect, etc.). Each card has a footer panel:

> **UNFILLED FOR 2 DOMAINS**
>   [Operational Data] [Regulatory Data]

That's every data domain in the org that has no holder of this
role scoped to it. Pair it with the inline holder list above
(`Devon Kershaw — DOMAIN: Customer Data`) and you can read the
coverage gap end-to-end without leaving the page.

To exercise this: assign the same trio you used in Module 4.3 as
Data Owner (scope = domain):

- *Customer Data* → **Devon Kershaw**
- *Operational Data* → **Jennifer Vasquez**
- *Regulatory Data* → **Lorraine Kimura**

Each chip should move out of the amber *Unfilled* panel into the
holder list, and the sub-line under each name lists the domain
they own. The Data Domains page and the DAMA-role assignment are
two views on the same accountability — keeping them aligned is
what closes the coverage gap.

### 7.4 Governance Groups

1. *Working in…* → **Tidewater Utilities**.
2. **Governance → Groups** → click **Generate standard structure**.
3. The DAMA hierarchy lands: Council → Office → Committee →
   Stewardship → Working Groups → Communities of Practice.
4. Click the **Data Governance Committee**.
5. The **Expected Roles** panel shows the roles the group should have.
   Notice for domain-scoped roles (Data Owner, Domain Owner, Data
   Steward, Domain Steward, Data Architect) a sub-line under each
   holder lists their owned/stewarded domains, or `no data domains
   assigned` in red if they have none.

### 7.5 RACI Matrix

1. **Governance → Roles** → **RACI Matrix tab**.
2. The matrix is auto-derived from your role assignments and
   ownership data.
3. Click any cell to cycle R → A → C → I → clear as a manual override.
4. Look for **validation warnings** — rule violations (no R, no A,
   multiple A's) surface inline.

---

## Module 8 — Build a real report (10 min)

The Report Builder (shipped recently). This is where you produce real
artifacts for stakeholders.

### 8.1 First report: Activities by Risk

1. **Insights → Review → Reports** → **+ New report**.
2. **Starting entity**: Processes.
3. **Columns**: tick `Name`, `Level`, `Status`, `Risk Level`.
4. Under **Joined fields → Responsible Person**: tick `Name`.
5. Under **Joined fields → Required Skills**: tick `Name`.
6. **Filters**: add → field = `Level`, op = `equals`, value =
   `ACTIVITY`.
7. **Sort**: Risk Level descending.
8. The preview pane refreshes live (350 ms after each edit).
9. **Name**: *Activities by Risk*, **Description**: *All electric +
   water activities ranked by risk*. **Visibility**: Shared with org.
10. Save.

### 8.2 Second report: Data Assets without Owners

1. **+ New report** again.
2. Entity: Data Assets.
3. Columns: `Name`, `Description`, `Governance Tier`, `Health Score`.
4. Under **Joined fields → Owner**: tick `Name`.
5. Filter: `Owner ID` is empty.
6. Sort by `Health Score` ascending.
7. Save as *Ownerless data assets*.

### 8.3 What just happened

Every Report Builder report reads from the same **Logical Data Model**
(LDM) that the in-app pickers expose. When Procela later moves to
Postgres, the same LDM will translate to database views that Power BI
/ Tableau / Cognos can connect to with standard SQL credentials. The
business model is the source of truth on both paths.

---

## Module 9 — Find and fix gaps (10 min)

### 9.1 Gap Detection

**Insights → Review → Gap Detection** surfaces:

- **Unmapped activities** — activities with no data link
- **Ungoverned assets** — assets below Silver / Gold tier supporting
  critical processes
- **Ungoverned columns** — a column an asset is bound to (it carries a
  physical source) but with no quality rule — coverage you claimed but
  never measure
- **Ownerless items** — entities with no owner assigned

Each gap clicks through to the item where you can resolve it.

**Tip — work the coverage gap on the asset list.** The **Data Assets**
page has a rules filter (*Has rules* / *No rules* / *Rules but
unmeasured*, each with a live count). *No rules* is the same DQ-coverage
gap Gap Detection surfaces, but filterable right on the registry;
*Rules but unmeasured* catches the sneakier case — assets that *look*
governed but whose health is only an **estimate** (badged *Est*) because
no rule has produced a real measured result yet. Point a connector (or a
CSV upload) at those next.

### 9.2 Data Mapping orphans

If you regenerated the process hierarchy in Module 3 (or deleted
activities), the Data Mapping page may show an orphan banner: *"N
orphan mappings found"*. Click **Delete all orphans** to clean them.

### 9.3 Orphan Assets (reverse view)

Different orphan, different page. **Data → Orphan Assets** lists data
assets that exist in the catalog but no process step references them
— "what data do we have that nobody's using?". Each row links to the
asset detail so you can either retire it or map it to a step that
should be using it. The Dashboard's Governance Gaps card surfaces the
count too.

This is the reverse of the forward Discover loop (Suggested data
assets from Module 3.5): forward asks "what data supports this
step?", reverse asks "what step should use this asset?".

### 9.4 Skill Gaps revisited

Dashboard → **Skill Gaps** should now show real values now that
activities have required-skill data and people have skills.

### 9.5 Data Quality auto-issues

**Data → Data Quality** lists rules per asset/column. When you add a
rule, the *Column* picker (populated from the asset's columns) lets you
target one specific column — the bound set — or the asset as a whole.
Both the Quality and Rules tabs have a free-text search box, so you can
find an asset by name or a rule by rule name / asset / column. Set a
rule's *Frequency* to Hourly / Daily / Weekly and it runs
automatically — no cron, no external orchestrator. When a run
transitions a rule to FAILING, Procela auto-creates a
governance issue (severity HIGH), assigns it to the domain
steward, and pings the assignee via the notification bell.
When the rule recovers, the same issue auto-resolves. The
end-to-end shape: define the rule once, walk away, and the
platform does the rest — see the Data Quality section of the
Help Guide for the full mechanics.

### 9.6 Cross-page coherence

Test this end-to-end:

1. From Dashboard, click the **Coverage** KPI tile.
2. You land on Data Mapping with the unmapped-activity banner.
3. Click an unmapped activity → drops you into Process Catalog on
   that node.
4. Add a data-asset input from the panel.
5. Return to Data Mapping → the count went down by one.

The same data, different views — that's the Procela model.

## Module 10 — Governance program + documents (10 min)

### 10.1 Generate governance processes

1. *Working in…* → **Tidewater Utilities** (parent company).
2. **Processes** → **Generate governance processes** (separate wand
   from the operational one).
3. This creates a *governance* value stream alongside the operational
   ones — Phase 1 Foundation, Phase 2 Design, Phase 3 People &
   Process, Phase 4 Operationalisation.

Now switch **Working in…** back to **Tidewater Electric**. Notice
two things: the governance value stream you just created
*doesn't appear* on the division's Process Catalog, and the
**Generate governance processes** wand is not visible on this
scope either. Both are by design: enterprise governance is one
program for the whole org tree, so a division shouldn't be able
to see it in its catalog counts *or* be able to accidentally
create its own. Switch back up to Tidewater Utilities whenever
you need to touch the enterprise governance program.

### 10.2 Governance Documents

1. **Governance → Documents**.
2. The seed includes a **Charter** (CHA-001), **Data Policies**
   (POL-001), **Data Standards** (STD-001), and a few starter
   documents.
3. Add controls to a Policy: expand the row → controls panel. Each
   control has a type (Preventive / Detective / Corrective) and an
   automation mode (Human / Agent / Hybrid).

### 10.3 Governance Program Maturity

**Governance → Governance Program** shows the current phase + auto-
computed completion status. **Phase 1** is Foundation Definition;
the program can't launch until it's complete (the platform pops a
confirmation if you try to advance early, listing exactly what's
missing).

### 10.4 Council Scorecard + Exceptions

The **Council Scorecard** (**Insights → Review → Council Scorecard**)
is the monthly report card a governance council reads: each child
division reports four measures — Tier-1 domain coverage, asset
classification, open issues over 30 days, and exceptions past expiry —
and they roll up to a true **Enterprise** total (computed across the
whole subtree, not an average). Open it now and you'll see the two
domains you flagged Tier-1 in Module 4.3 driving the coverage number,
plus two auto-drafted narratives ("What moved this month", "For the
council").

1. As a **CDO** or **Data Governance Lead** (or an org admin), click
   **Edit** — every derived cell becomes editable and you can override
   any measure or rewrite a narrative. An overridden cell keeps the
   machine value underneath and is marked, so the council can see what
   was adjusted; **Reset** puts it back to derived.
2. Click **Publish snapshot** to freeze this month as an immutable
   version. The version-history panel reopens any past month read-only —
   that's your historical reference for how governance moved
   quarter over quarter.

To feed the *Exceptions past expiry* measure, visit **Governance →
Operate → Exceptions** and grant a waiver with an expiry date in the
past — it flags red on that page and increments the exceptions column
on the scorecard. Close it and the count drops. This is the auditable
way a control gets waived instead of quietly going unmet.

---

## Module 11 — Ask AI for grounded answers (5 min)

The platform has an AI assistant that's grounded in *your* catalog —
not training data — so it answers about the org you just built.

### 11.1 Open the panel

Click **Ask AI** in the top bar. That's the only entry point — the
floating bottom-right bubble is gone; the top-bar button is where
you open, minimize, and resume the chat. Four starter prompts
appear when the chat is empty:

- Where are our data gaps?
- Which assets are below 80% health and linked to critical processes?
- Which data assets do we have that no process uses?
- Which systems run our customer-facing processes?

### 11.2 Try the orphan question

Click **Which data assets do we have that no process uses?**.

Watch the reply stream in token-by-token — there's no "Thinking…"
pause. The assistant should name one or more of the orphan assets
from Module 9.3. Each asset name is a **link** — click it and you
land on the asset's page in the catalog. That's inline citation
working: the assistant didn't just describe your data, it pointed at
the rows you can act on.

### 11.3 Notice the navigation chip

At the end of the same answer you should see a green pill-shaped
chip — *Orphan Assets →*. That's the page-navigation chip: the
assistant decided the right next step was opening the Orphan Assets
page, and gave you a one-click handoff. Click it and you land on
/data-assets/orphans.

The chip is constrained to a fixed allowlist of Procela pages so a
hallucinated route can't render as a broken button.

### 11.4 Try a coverage question

Type *"What systems run our Outage triage process?"*. The assistant
answers from the activity ↔ system declarations you made in the
Process Catalog (Module 3), with the system names rendered as links
to the Systems page. Switch the **Working in…** scope to Water and
ask the same question — the answer re-grounds to the new org.

### 11.5 Minimize and continue working

Click the `–` in the panel header to close the panel and keep
working elsewhere in the app — the conversation is preserved.
Notice the **Ask AI** top-bar button now shows a small count badge
telling you a chat is paused. Click it to resume; every message
is where you left it. To clear history and start over, click
**New chat** in the panel header — that's the only way to reset
the conversation.

### 11.6 What it won't do

The assistant answers and points; it doesn't act. It won't delete an
orphan, change ownership, or transition a process status — those
stay manual. Use it as a navigation aid and a gap-detector, not as a
mutation surface.

---

## Module 12 — Weekly digest of gap deltas (5 min)

Procela closes the loop by surfacing week-over-week movement in the
same gap signals from Module 9. Instead of you remembering to check
the dashboard every Monday, the platform pings the notifications
bell when something meaningful changes.

### 12.1 Take the baseline

The first digest run for an org records a baseline; subsequent runs
diff against it. For the prototype the trigger is manual — hit:

```
POST /api/v1/digest/run?orgId=<your-active-org-id>
```

Use the API console or `curl` with your access token. The response
includes `baseline: true` and `notificationsWritten: 0` — no bell
ping yet, just a recorded starting point.

### 12.2 Create a change worth noticing

Add three more unmapped assets in **Data Assets** (or remove a few
mappings to drop coverage by 5+ points), then run the digest endpoint
again.

### 12.3 Read the notification

Open the bell in the top bar. New entries should land — for example:

- *"3 new orphan data assets this week"* → links to **Data → Orphan Assets**
- *"Mapping coverage dropped to 72%"* → links to **Insights → Explore → Process ↔ Data Map**
- *"2 new ownerless processes"* → links to **Processes**

Each entry is one click from the affected page; thresholds are
conservative (3+ orphans, 5+ percentage points, 1+ ownerless
process) so small day-to-day noise doesn't accumulate noise in the
bell.

### 12.4 Scheduling

The digest doesn't need you to remember to run it. Procela ships a
built-in scheduler that fires every hour and, on the first tick
after Sunday 23:00 UTC each week, walks every org and runs the
digest for you. The last-fired timestamp is persisted, so a restart
in the firing window doesn't double-notify.

The same scheduler also runs an **overdue task sweep** every hour:
any governance task with a due date in the past — status OPEN,
IN_PROGRESS, or PENDING_APPROVAL — writes a *Task overdue: …*
warning into the notifications bell for its assignee (or org-wide
if the task is unassigned). It's idempotent — the sweep stamps the
task after firing and re-arms itself only when the due date is
pushed forward or the task cycles back to OPEN. `POST
/api/v1/governance-tasks/sweep-overdue` triggers the same code
synchronously if you want to drive it from the API console.

The manual `POST /api/v1/digest/run` trigger from 12.1 still works
— use it for one-off runs (e.g., before a demo). Disable all
background loops (this scheduler included) by setting
`PROCELA_DISABLE_SCHEDULERS=1` — set it on every replica except the one
designated to run scheduled work, so jobs fire once rather than once
per replica.

## Quick reference

### The Procela model in one paragraph

Procela's data model has three layers that meet in the middle. The
**business layer** (Value Streams → Processes → Sub-Processes →
Activities → Tasks) describes what the business does. The **data
layer** (Data Assets, Systems, Data Domains) describes what powers
it. **Mappings** are the bridge — they link activities to the data
assets / governance documents / attachments they consume or produce.
Wrapping all three are people (with their **skills** and **DAMA
roles**), grouped into **Governance Groups**, governed by
**Documents** (charters, policies, standards), and held accountable
via the **RACI Matrix**.

### Where things live

| If you're looking for… | Go to |
|---|---|
| The business model | Processes (Process Catalog) |
| Data registries | Data Assets, Systems, Data Domains |
| Cross-process audit of links | Insights → Data Mapping |
| Who does what | Organizations → People, Governance → Roles |
| Standing committees | Governance → Groups |
| Policies + standards | Governance → Documents |
| Reports + scorecards | Insights → Reports |
| Council report card (division rollup) | Insights → Review → Council Scorecard |
| Policy waivers / exceptions | Governance → Operate → Exceptions |
| Pivot exploration | Insights → Analysis |
| Where are the gaps? | Dashboard → Gaps section + Insights → Gap Detection |
| Live source metadata / freshness | Systems → Connections (if Procela can reach the DB) or Settings → On-prem connectors (if it can't) |
| Help / shortcuts | Top-bar **Help** button (next to Ask AI); press `?` for keyboard shortcuts |

### Keyboard shortcuts to know

- `?` — open the shortcut overlay
- `g then d` — go to Dashboard
- `g then p` — go to Processes (Catalog)
- `g then a` — go to Data Assets
- `g then s` — go to Systems
- `g then o` — go to People
- `g then r` — go to Reports
- `/` — focus search (on supported pages)

### Three things to demo to a stakeholder

1. **Generate processes for two divisions side-by-side.** Same wand,
   same code; the electric output is electric-utility, the water
   output is water-utility. That's active-org context driving AI.
2. **Cross-page link traversal.** From a Data Asset, *Where Used* →
   process steps consuming it. From a person, click a role chip →
   drawer. The cross-references make the business-process-first
   model tangible.
3. **RACI auto-derivation.** Assignments on the Catalog → RACI rows
   auto-derived → validation warnings flag rule violations (no R, no
   A, multiple A's).

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause / fix |
|---|---|
| Dashboard KPIs show 0 after import | Wrong *Working in…* scope. Switch to the org you imported into. |
| Can't see imported people on People page | Same as above — *Working in…* picker. People are scoped per org. |
| AI process generation hangs > 30 s | First run for an (industry + org) is a live Claude call. Subsequent runs hit the cache. Check the *Cached* / *Fresh from AI* badge. |
| Cross-division link warning won't dismiss | It's a soft warn, not block — confirm it to create the link, cancel to skip. |
| Orphan mappings appear after wand re-run | Regenerating processes mints new UUIDs. Use **Delete all orphans** on Data Mapping. |
| Sign-in hangs in dev mode | `REDIS_URL` set in `.env` without Redis running. Either unset it or start Redis. |
| New typecheck / test failure on trunk | CI runs on push; check the GitHub Actions tab for the actual error. Locally: `npm run lint --workspaces && npm test`. |
