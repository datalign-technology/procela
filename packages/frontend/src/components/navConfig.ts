// navConfig — the source of truth for sidebar structure.
//
// Lives outside Layout.tsx so the data tables don't bury the shell logic
// (Layout used to be ~1700 lines, most of it lookup tables). The shape
// here is:
//
//   navSections      ordered list of grouped sections rendered as the
//                    accordion in the desktop sidebar.
//   ROUTE_GROUPS     route-prefix aliases used to decide which item is
//                    "active" so /report → /reports highlights Reports.
//   GET_STARTED_ITEM the conditional "Get Started" entry pinned at the
//                    top of the rail while setup is incomplete.
//   bottomNavItems   the Settings cluster pinned to the bottom.
//                    Help was retired in favour of the top-bar Help
//                    button (openHelpWindow) so the guide opens in a
//                    popup without navigating the user away.
//   MOBILE_PRIMARY   the four primary destinations pinned to the mobile
//                    bottom bar; the fifth slot is the Menu button.
//
// `openHelpWindow` lives here because both the sidebar and the top-bar
// Help button call it; keeping it next to the Help nav item makes the
// behavioural contract obvious.
